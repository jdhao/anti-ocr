# Why this project?

People are worried that the image they send to their friend are filtered and
tested by the third party Apps they use. A common technology to understand what
you have send via image is OCR.

If we could somehow decrease the probabilty of OCR engine to recognize and
understand the text in an image, we could make the info we send *safer* to some
extent.

This project is aimed at generating text images which are hard for OCR engine
to break or modifying existing images so that OCR engines do not know the
meaning of text in the images.

# How to use?

TBD...
